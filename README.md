# Natural-language-to-SQL

This project converts **natural language queries** into **SQL queries** using the **T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer)** model. T5 is a versatile transformer-based architecture that treats every NLP problem as a text-to-text task, making it suitable for translating user-friendly queries into structured SQL statements.

---

##  Objectives
- **Natural Language â†’ SQL Translation**: Train T5 to generate SQL queries from natural language questions.
- **Utilize Spider Dataset**: Use the [Spider dataset](https://yale-lily.github.io/spider) â€” a benchmark containing complex SQL queries across multiple database schemas â€” to ensure robustness and generalization.

---

##  Dataset
We use the **Spider dataset**, known for its complexity and cross-domain variety:

- **Natural Language Questions** â€“ English phrases describing database queries.
- **SQL Queries** â€“ Corresponding structured queries.
- **Database Schemas** â€“ Tables, columns, and relationships from multiple databases.

##  Model
The **T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer)** model treats every NLP task as a text-to-text problem. This allows it to be trained for various tasks, including **NL-to-SQL translation**.

##  Training & Evaluation
- **Training**: Fine-tune T5 on the Spider dataset to learn NL â†’ SQL mapping.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Query Accuracy
  - Execution Accuracy
  - Generalization to complex queries

---

##  Use Cases
- **Database Query Generation** â€“ Auto-generate SQL queries from user-friendly input.
- **Query Understanding** â€“ Make database interaction more intuitive.

---

##  Expected Outcomes
- **Enhanced User Interaction** â€“ Simplified database access via natural language.
- **Robust Model** â€“ Trained on diverse schemas and queries.
